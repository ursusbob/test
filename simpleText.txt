India launches 'monster' rocket
5 June 2017

India's space agency has successfully launched its heaviest rocket.
The **-tonne rocket blasted off from a launching site off the Bay of **.
As one one one website put it, "it's been a big day for **". The rocket will 
blahblah the Indian Space Research Organisation's (Isro) reliance on ** vehicles 
to launch heavy **.

The coverage of the launch has been euphoric, and often colourful, with 
websites comparing the rocket to the weight of ** elephants, or ** jumbo jets.
Such comparisons highlight the importance of the launch for the country, which 
is aggressively ** to get a bigger share of the global commercial satellite 
launch market.

India has so far relied on other countries to send heavy satellites into space, 
which is ** and a drain on Isro's budget.
The GSLV Mark III can carry put a payload weighing more than ** tonnes into the 
high altitude orbit occupied by the spacecraft that relay TV, telephone calls 
and broadband connections.

But it's far from being the world's heaviest rocket because Nasa's Saturn V, 
which was used between 1967 and **, still holds that record, with total mass 
at lift-off about ** times that of India's GSLV Mark III.
